## Overview

This started as a collabrative map app with a few friends, you can see this in the Repo link in the description. I ended up coding my entire application from scratch individually and then pushed to a developmental branch with my name and then created an individual Repo here for others to see my code. I wanted to learn how to use Vue instead of React to add to my resume and skillset as well as use a Map api such as Google but instead used Leaflet. The goal was to make an interactive map, a location search, and a marker on a chosen location. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an interactive map
- Search a Location
- Click on Location Search and a Marker should show up on Location in Map
- Should have a Mobile View

### Links

- Live Site URL: [LIVE WEB PAGE](https://nvious7-vue-map-app.netlify.app/)

## My process

### Built with

- Vue 3
- Leaflet
- Vuetify
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use Vue.js instead of React.js as well as Leaflet maps similar to Google's. I also learned how to use Vuetify instead of Material UI due to building this application on Vue and not React.

### Continued development

In the future, I would love to have Geolocation, I do have a snippet of commented code using Geolocation, however I have not implemented a marker system on the Geolocation. I would also like to use Google Maps in another application to try it as well as involve Autocorrect.
